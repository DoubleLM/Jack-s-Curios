                            This pair of sunglasses is supposedly a haunted artifact. Jack was told by previous owner
                            Marc Szabo that they were left behind at a closed-down asylum, and that Marc had acquired
                            them from a friend who had taken them from a patient's room.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Marc claimed that he would hear knocking, crying, and laughter late at night originating
                            either from the glasses or nearby the glasses, and he donated this pair to hopefully stop
                            the hauntings at his house.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, Marc Szabo would tragically pass away in a house fire not long after his
                            donation.
                        </p>

                            That was your first real arson. Better yet, the smoke inhalation would always be what killed
                            him. You didn't have to do anything but lace his tea with sleeping drugs. A nice, simple,
                            clean kill.
                        </p>

                            Jack Rivers has yet to experience any paranormal activity around the museum.
