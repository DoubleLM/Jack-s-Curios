                        <p>
                            This prototype watch was supposedly built by the Rolex company in an early attempt to
                            capitalize on digital watch faces. It bears little resemblance to the classic Rolexes known
                            and loved by watch aficionados worldwide, and the idea seemed to have been abandoned early
                            on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jack acquired this prototype via an anonymous donor who claimed to have previously worked
                            for Rolex during the time this was built. The donor claimed that the watch was a gift from
                            one of the people actually involved with the project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            According to the donor, the “N” logo was originally meant to belong to a subsidiary company,
                            as Rolex themselves were reluctant to launch the product based solely on their reputation as
                            analog watch crafters. Eventually, the model was scrapped late in development, leaving Jack
                            as one of around a dozen people to own a constructed prototype.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The watch held the same prestige as a typical Rolex, and was expected to market somewhere in
                            the 1000-2000$ range.
                        </P>
